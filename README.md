I've created "Elemento," a pixel art battle game with character customization and elemental powers. The game features:

## Key Features

1. **Character Customization**

1. Customize hair, skin, and outfit colors
2. Choose 2 elemental powers from 7 options (lightning, fire, ice, water, air, lava, rock)
3. Name your character



2. **Battle System**

1. Turn-based combat against increasingly difficult enemies
2. Elemental attacks with effectiveness based on enemy types
3. Health and XP tracking



3. **Progression System**

1. Gain XP by defeating enemies
2. Level up to increase stats
3. Unlock new weapons as you level up



4. **Pixel Art Design**

1. Green and black color scheme as requested
2. Pixel art rendering for characters and environments
3. Character designs inspired by your reference image





## How It Works

The game uses HTML Canvas for rendering the pixel art graphics and React for the UI components. The character customization system lets players create unique characters with different appearances and elemental abilities, which affect combat strategy.

The game is built with Next.js and uses client-side state management to track game progress, with localStorage to persist the player's character between sessions.
